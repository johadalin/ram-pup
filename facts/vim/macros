Use vim macros to record a set of commands/steps that can then be easily repeated.
Hit `q + <letter to save macro to>` to begin recording, perform the actions you want to save, and then `q` again in command mode to stop recording. 
Run your macro using `@ + <macro binding letter>`.
(This can be really powerful, but a bit fiddly to get going)
