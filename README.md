# Ram-pup
Useful, generic 'how to basic' for computing. Windows productivity, and linux (primarily Ubuntu) command line basics

## Goal
There's a lot of ways to do things. Amazingly, given this, it's always amazing how many people might not know them. As a start, i'm going to try to compile a bunch of the most useful things I know for basic survival in Windows productivity, and linux command line tools.

**If this actually goes anywhere, and you want to expand the information in a section, submit a new factoid, or expand the project to cover an entirely new sector, please do; raise pull requests, fork and push back upstream, or raise issues with the information you have or want**

## How to how to basic
Once this is actually more than a readme, this should become a setup guide. How to use, how to add more info, etc.

## Futures
A place to store things to work on. Got more? Raise a PR, and/or get involved. I'll probably get bored solo.
A few suggestions on places to start raising ~~objections~~suggestions...

* How could this be better?
* How should I have architected this?
* Why I should be doing X, rather than Y?
* How utterly, completely, vehemently wrong i am for suggesting `netstat -planut` over the clearly superior `-tunapl`

clearly the list could go on

## Initial basics

* Host the factoids as a navigatable set of cards in a webserver or something 'user friendly'
  * Have them link through to the repo
* Have some semblance of structure in facts
  * tags?
  * modules?
* support for users? who could
  * pin favourites
  * mark facts as known
* Have a module for accepting submissions through a web UI
